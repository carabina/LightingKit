     - permissionCompletion: The closure to execute when permission request completes.

     - Returns: An initialized `LightingKitPermission` object.

     lifetime of the object. Any objects used within should be declared `weak` or `unowned`.

     - completion: The closure to execute when permission request completes.
     If access was granted, `true` will be passed, othewise `false`.
     - Warning: A reference to the `completion` closure is kept after escaping and therefore any references to
     `self` within *will* be captured.
     - Warning: The application's Info.plist file must contain the `NSHomeKitUsageDescription` key
     and a corresponding value, else the application will exit immediately on execution of this method.
